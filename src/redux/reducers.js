/*

 * Here's a breakdown of what this code does:
 
 * It imports the combineReducers function from the 'redux' library. This function is used to combine multiple reducers into a single reducer that can manage different parts of your application's state.
 
 * It defines two separate reducers, user and cars, using arrow functions. These reducers are responsible for managing specific parts of the state.
 
 * The user reducer takes the current state as its parameter, and if no state is provided (defaulted to null), it returns the state unchanged. In this case, it effectively doesn't modify the user part of the state.
 
 * The cars reducer behaves similarly to the user reducer. It takes the current state as its parameter and, if no state is provided (defaulted to an empty array []), it returns the state unchanged. This reducer also doesn't modify the cars part of the state.
 
 * It exports the result of combining the user and cars reducers using the combineReducers function. The combined reducers are structured as an object with keys representing different parts of the state and corresponding reducer functions.
 
 * In this case, the exported reducer is a combination of the user and cars reducers, and it manages both the user and cars parts of your application's Redux state.
 
 By exporting this combined reducer, you create a single root reducer that can be used when configuring your Redux store. Each individual reducer (user and cars) manages its respective part of the state within the root reducer. This structure allows you to modularize and organize your state management as your application grows.
